# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

This code is not yet released. Do not preserve backwards compatibility when making changes.

Before making changes, review `CONTRIBUTING.md` for commit message requirements.

## Before Committing

**IMPORTANT:** Always run `make generate` before committing changes. This command:
1. Regenerates protobuf code (Go and TypeScript)
2. Rebuilds the UI (runs `npm run build` which includes TypeScript type checking)

If `make generate` fails, fix the errors before committing. Common issues:
- TypeScript type errors in test mocks (cast mock responses with `as unknown as ...`)
- Missing protobuf imports after adding new message types

## Implementing Plans

Plans are recorded as GitHub issues. Implement each plan on a feature branch with regular commits in a single PR that references the issue.

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main` for the plan.
2. **Make regular commits** as you work. Each commit should be a logical unit of change.
3. **Open a PR** when the work is complete. Include `Closes: #NN` (where NN is the issue number) in the PR description so the issue is automatically closed when the PR is merged.
4. **Loop on PR checks**: after pushing, watch CI checks (`gh pr checks <N> --watch`) and fix any failures. Iterate until all checks pass.
5. **Merge via merge commit** once all checks pass: `gh pr merge <N> --merge`. Do not squash or rebase — the project uses merge commits so that commit SHAs referenced in screenshot URLs remain reachable in `main` history.

### Test Strategy

**Prefer unit tests over E2E tests.** Rendering, interaction, navigation logic, and ConnectRPC data shaping all belong in unit tests using mocked query hooks. Reserve E2E tests for:
- The OIDC login flow (requires a real Dex server)
- Full-stack CRUD round-trips that verify server-side behavior (requires a real Kubernetes cluster)

When a behavior can be verified with a unit test, write a unit test. Do not add an E2E test for the same behavior.

### Identifying Your Agent Slot

Agents run in worktrees whose path encodes the agent slot. Identify your slot from your working directory — for example, if `pwd` is `/path/to/worktrees/holos-run/agent-2/secrets-manager`, your slot is `agent-2`.

**Issue title**: Prepend the slot to issue titles created by the agent so they show up clearly in `gh issue list`, e.g. `[agent-2] feat: add Playwright E2E test infrastructure`.

**PR title**: Use a conventional commit prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `build:`, `refactor:`, `test:`). Do **not** include the agent slot — strip it if working from an issue title that contains one.

**PR description**: Include the slot in the footer so reviewers know which agent produced the work.

**PR comment**: After creating the PR, post a comment explaining the rationale and motivation for the implementation approach, including alternatives considered and why they were rejected.

Example workflow:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/add-playwright-config
# ... implement changes, committing as you go ...
git commit -m "Add webServer configuration to playwright.config.ts

Configure Playwright to automatically start Go backend and Vite dev
server before running E2E tests."

# Determine agent slot from working directory
SLOT=$(pwd | grep -oP 'agent-\d+' || echo "agent-0")

# Open a PR that closes the plan issue
# Note: PR title uses conventional commit format — no agent slot prefix
gh pr create --title "feat: add Playwright E2E test infrastructure" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Configure Playwright to start Go backend and Vite dev server
- Add E2E test for the login flow

Closes: #42

## Architecture

This is a Go HTTPS server that serves a web console UI and exposes ConnectRPC services. The built UI is embedded into the Go binary via `//go:embed` for single-binary deployment.

### Package Structure

- `cmd/` - Main entrypoint, calls into cli package
- `cli/` - Cobra CLI setup with Cobra flags for listen addr, TLS, OIDC, RBAC, logging config
- `console/` - Core server package
  - `console.go` - HTTP server setup, TLS, route registration, embedded UI serving
  - `version.go` - Version info with embedded version files and ldflags
  - `rpc/` - ConnectRPC handler implementations and auth interceptor
  - `oidc/` - Embedded Dex OIDC provider
  - `organizations/` - OrganizationService with K8s Namespace backend and annotation-based grants
  - `projects/` - ProjectService with K8s Namespace backend and annotation-based grants
  - `resolver/` - Namespace prefix resolver translating user-facing names to K8s namespace names (`{namespace-prefix}{organization-prefix}{name}` for orgs, `{namespace-prefix}{project-prefix}{name}` for projects)
  - `secrets/` - SecretsService with K8s backend and annotation-based RBAC
  - `dist/` - Embedded static files served at `/` (build output from frontend, not source)
- `proto/` - Protobuf source files
- `gen/` - Generated protobuf Go code (do not edit)
- `frontend/` - React frontend source (see UI Architecture below)

### UI Architecture

React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 8 app in the `frontend/` directory.

- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS v4
- **Routing**: TanStack Router with file-based routing (serves at `/`)
- **Server state**: TanStack Query v5 with ConnectRPC Query integration (`@connectrpc/connect-query`)
- **Auth**: oidc-client-ts library with OIDC PKCE flow
- **Generated types**: `frontend/src/gen/` contains TypeScript protobuf types generated by buf

Key files:
- `frontend/src/main.tsx` - Entry with TransportProvider, QueryClientProvider, RouterProvider
- `frontend/src/routes/__root.tsx` - Root layout with sidebar navigation
- `frontend/src/routes/_authenticated.tsx` - Auth layout with OIDC redirect
- `frontend/src/lib/auth.ts` - Auth context with OIDC PKCE flow
- `frontend/src/lib/transport.ts` - ConnectRPC transport setup with Bearer token injection
- `frontend/src/routes/` - File-based route definitions

### Authentication

OIDC PKCE flow: Requires `--enable-insecure-dex` flag for embedded Dex at `/dex/`, or an external OIDC provider configured with `--issuer`. Tokens stored in session storage, sent as `Authorization: Bearer` headers. Default credentials: `admin` / `verysecret` (override with `HOLOS_DEX_INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME`/`PASSWORD` env vars).

Backend auth: `LazyAuthInterceptor` in `console/rpc/auth.go` verifies JWTs from the `Authorization: Bearer` header and stores `rpc.Claims` in context. Lazy initialization avoids startup race with embedded Dex.

### RBAC

Three-tier access control model evaluated in order (highest role wins):

1. **Organization-level**: Per-org grants stored as JSON annotations on K8s Namespace objects (prefix configurable via `--organization-prefix`, default `org-`)
2. **Project-level**: Per-project grants stored as JSON annotations on K8s Namespace objects (prefix configurable via `--project-prefix`, default `prj-`)
3. **Secret-level**: Per-secret grants stored as JSON annotations on K8s Secret objects

Grant annotations: `holos.run/share-users`, `holos.run/share-roles`

The `--metadata-domain` flag (default `"holos.run"`) configures the domain part
of all console-managed Kubernetes label and annotation keys and the value of
the standard `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by` label.

Namespace prefix scheme (three-part naming: `{namespace-prefix}{type-prefix}{name}`):
- Organizations: `{namespace-prefix}{organization-prefix}{name}` (resource-type label: `organization`)
- Projects: `{namespace-prefix}{project-prefix}{name}` (resource-type label: `project`, optional organization label for IAM inheritance, project label stores project name)

The `--namespace-prefix` flag (default `"holos-"`) prefixes all console-managed namespace names, enabling multi-instance isolation in the same cluster (e.g., `prod-org-acme`, `ci-prj-api`).

Organization creation is controlled by `--disable-org-creation`, `--org-creator-users`, and `--org-creator-roles` CLI flags. By default all authenticated principals can create organizations (implicit grant). Setting `--disable-org-creation` disables this implicit grant; explicit `--org-creator-users` and `--org-creator-roles` lists are still honored.

The `--roles-claim` flag (default `"groups"`) configures which OIDC token claim is used to extract role memberships. This allows integration with identity providers that use non-standard claim names (e.g., `realm_roles`).

Roles: VIEWER (1), EDITOR (2), OWNER (3) defined in `proto/holos/console/v1/rbac.proto`

### Code Generation

Protobuf code is generated using buf. The `generate.go` file contains the `//go:generate buf generate` directive. After modifying `.proto` files in `proto/`, run:

```bash
make generate   # or: go generate ./...
```

This produces:
- `gen/**/*.pb.go` - Go structs for messages
- `gen/**/consolev1connect/*.connect.go` - ConnectRPC client/server bindings
- `frontend/src/gen/**/*_pb.ts` - TypeScript message classes and service definitions (protobuf-es v2)

### Adding New RPCs

1. Define RPC and messages in `proto/holos/console/v1/*.proto`
2. Run `make generate`
3. Implement handler method in `console/rpc/` (embed `Unimplemented*Handler` for forward compatibility)
4. Handler is auto-wired when service is registered in `console/console.go`

See `docs/rpc-service-definitions.md` for detailed examples.

### Testing Patterns

**Preference: unit tests first, E2E only for full-stack behaviours.**  
Rendering, interaction, navigation logic, and ConnectRPC data shaping belong in unit tests with mocked query hooks. Reserve E2E for the OIDC login flow and real Kubernetes CRUD round-trips.

See `docs/testing.md` for the complete decision rule, the ConnectRPC mock pattern with a worked example, file-naming conventions for route-directory test files, and a table of all existing test files.

**Go tests**: Standard `*_test.go` files with table-driven tests. Uses `k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes/fake` for K8s operations. CLI integration tests use `testscript` in `console/testscript_test.go`.

**UI unit tests**: Vitest + React Testing Library + jsdom. Mock query hooks (`@/queries/*`) with `vi.mock()` and `vi.fn()`. Route-directory test files must be prefixed with `-` (e.g. `-about.test.tsx`) so TanStack Router's generator ignores them. Run with `make test-ui`.

**E2E tests**: Playwright in `frontend/e2e/`. `make test-e2e` orchestrates the full stack (builds Go binary, starts Go backend on :8443 and Vite on :5173). For tight iteration, start servers once and run targeted tests — see `docs/e2e-testing.md` for the full workflow including K8s-backed tests.

See `docs/frontend-patterns.md` for common UI patterns (copy-to-clipboard, toast notifications).

### Version Management

Version is determined by:
1. `console/version/{major,minor,patch}` files (embedded at compile time)
2. `GitDescribe` ldflags override (set by Makefile during build)

Build metadata (commit, tree state, date) injected via ldflags in Makefile.

### Container Builds

Trigger container image builds using the `container.yaml` GitHub workflow. The workflow runs from `main` and accepts a `git_ref` input specifying what to check out and build, plus an optional `tag` input specifying the image tag to publish. When `tag` is omitted, manually dispatched builds use the checked-out commit's short SHA:

```bash
gh workflow run container.yaml --ref main -f git_ref=refs/heads/<branch-name>
gh workflow run container.yaml --ref main -f git_ref=refs/tags/v1.2.3 -f tag=v1.2.3
```

### Tool Dependencies

Tool versions are pinned in `tools.go` using the Go tools pattern. Install with `make tools`. Currently pins: buf.

## Planning and Execution

### Feature Planning

Plan features using phases. Record plans as GitHub issues before execution using `gh issue create`.

### Dispatching Plans to Agents

After drafting a plan as a GitHub issue, dispatch it to a Claude Code agent
in a new worktree:

    scripts/dispatch <issue-number>

This creates a git worktree at ../secrets-manager-<N>, opens a new tmux window
named i<N>, and starts a Claude Code agent that reads the issue and implements
the plan. The script returns immediately so the main agent can continue planning.

Prerequisite: must be run inside a tmux session.

### RED GREEN Implementation

Implement each phase using a RED GREEN approach:

1. **RED** - Write failing tests first that define the expected behavior.
2. **GREEN** - Write the minimum implementation to make the tests pass.

### Final Cleanup Phase

Every plan must include a final phase to scan the entire repository for dead, deprecated, or outdated information introduced or made stale by the commits implementing the plan. This includes removing obsolete comments, unused imports, stale documentation, dead code paths, and outdated references in AGENTS.md, README files, and doc files. Commit cleanup changes separately with a clear message explaining what was removed and why.

### Tracking Progress

When executing plans, record progress by checking off TODO items in the relevant GitHub issue using `gh issue edit` or the API. Keep issues up to date as each phase completes. When the PR is merged, the `Closes: #NN` line in the PR description automatically closes the issue.

## Browser Automation (agent-browser)

Coding agents can interact with the running console UI via `agent-browser`. This enables visual verification of changes, OIDC login automation, and end-to-end workflow testing through the browser.

### Setup

```bash
make agent-tools              # Install agent-browser + Chrome for Testing
scripts/test-agent-browser    # Verify installation
```

### Usage

All browser scripts require the dev stack running (`make run`). For hot reload verification, also run `make dev`. All browser scripts source `scripts/browser-env` and respect `HOLOS_BACKEND_PORT` / `HOLOS_VITE_PORT` environment variables (defaults: 8443 / 5173).

```bash
# Authenticate (OIDC auto-login via embedded Dex, no password prompt)
scripts/browser-login

# Clear session state (triggers fresh OIDC login on next navigation)
scripts/browser-logout

# Verify ID token and refresh token status on the profile page
scripts/browser-verify-change

# Run the full self-service workflow (create org → project → secret → verify → cleanup)
# Requires a Kubernetes cluster (e.g. k3d cluster create holos-dev)
scripts/browser-self-service

# Capture a screenshot of a secret detail page (or any URL)
scripts/browser-capture-secret [URL]

# Capture visual verification screenshots for a PR
# (runs scripts/pr-<N>/capture with agent-dev lifecycle)
scripts/browser-capture-pr <N>

# Test per-key trailing newline affordance in the secret grid
scripts/browser-test-newline
```

Screenshots are saved to `tmp/screenshots/`. After restarting the server, run `scripts/browser-logout && scripts/browser-login` to get a fresh OIDC token (the old Dex signing keys are invalidated).

### Per-Agent Dev Servers

`scripts/agent-dev` builds the frontend into the Go binary (`make generate` + `make build`), then starts the backend on a deterministic port (9000+N, where N is derived from the `agent-N` path segment in the working directory). It uses SIGPIPE-based lifecycle: the script writes the port assignment to stdout, then enters a heartbeat loop. When the pipe reader exits, SIGPIPE terminates the script and an EXIT trap kills the server. No PID files, no stale processes.

Usage (pipe pattern):
```bash
scripts/agent-dev | {
  eval "$(head -1)"                     # sets BACKEND_PORT
  export HOLOS_BACKEND_PORT=$BACKEND_PORT
  scripts/browser-login                 # uses HOLOS_BACKEND_URL
  scripts/browser-capture-secret        # uses HOLOS_BACKEND_URL
  # block exits → pipe breaks → SIGPIPE → server cleaned up
}
```

The Go backend serves the embedded frontend — no Vite dev server is needed for automated screenshot capture. This avoids OIDC port mismatch issues that arise when the Vite dev server runs on a different port than the backend.

`frontend/vite.config.ts` reads `HOLOS_BACKEND_PORT` and `HOLOS_VITE_PORT` from the environment (same defaults) for interactive development with `make dev`.

### Visual Verification for Frontend PRs

**REQUIRED**: Every PR that changes the web UI MUST include:
1. A PR-specific capture script at `scripts/pr-<N>/capture` that takes screenshots of the affected pages.
2. Playwright E2E tests in `frontend/e2e/` that assert the new or changed behavior is visible.
3. Screenshots committed to `docs/screenshots/pr-<N>/` and referenced in the PR.

This is not optional. A frontend PR is not complete until screenshots are captured, committed, and posted to the PR.

The generic launcher `scripts/browser-capture-pr <N>` handles the full agent-dev lifecycle (build, start backend, login, SIGPIPE cleanup) and calls the PR-specific capture script with these environment variables:
- `HOLOS_BACKEND_PORT` — the backend port
- `HOLOS_BACKEND_URL` — `https://localhost:$HOLOS_BACKEND_PORT`
- `PR_SCREENSHOT_DIR` — `docs/screenshots/pr-<N>/` (already created)

For simple cases (single page, no K8s fixtures needed), pass `--url` to skip writing a capture script:
```bash
scripts/browser-capture-pr <N> --url /profile
```
This navigates to the given path and saves `$PR_SCREENSHOT_DIR/screenshot.png` automatically.

For complex cases (multiple pages, K8s fixtures, multiple screenshots), write `scripts/pr-<N>/capture`:
- Apply any required K8s fixtures
- Use `agent-browser` to navigate and capture screenshots to `$PR_SCREENSHOT_DIR`
- The Go backend serves the built frontend — do not use Vite

Workflow:

1. **Add E2E tests** in `frontend/e2e/` asserting the new/changed behavior.
2. **Write the capture script** at `scripts/pr-<N>/capture` (or use `--url` for simple pages).
3. **Run it** after the PR is created to capture screenshots:
   ```bash
   scripts/browser-capture-pr <N>
   # or for simple pages:
   scripts/browser-capture-pr <N> --url /profile
   ```
4. **Commit images** to the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git add docs/screenshots/pr-<N>/ && git commit -m "Add visual verification screenshots for PR #<N>"
   git push
   ```
5. **Reference in PR** using the **commit SHA** in raw GitHub URLs so images remain accessible after the branch is deleted on merge:
   ```bash
   SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
   gh pr comment <N> --body "![description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holos-run/secrets-manager/${SHA}/docs/screenshots/pr-<N>/filename.png)"
   ```
   Using the commit SHA (not the branch name) is the conventional approach — the SHA is immutable and resolves correctly both before and after merge. **Important**: PRs with screenshot references must be merged using a **merge commit** (not squash), so the referenced commit SHA survives in the target branch history.
6. **Annotate**: Include a brief caption describing what the screenshot shows and which script produced it.

### Configuration

Project defaults are in `agent-browser.json`: headless mode, self-signed cert acceptance, 1920x1080 viewport, screenshots to `tmp/screenshots/`.
