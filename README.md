# Holos Secrets Manager

A Go HTTPS server that serves a web UI for managing Kubernetes secrets with OIDC authentication and role-based access control. The built UI is embedded into the Go binary for single-binary deployment.

## Quick Start

```bash
make certs   # Generate TLS certificates (one-time)
make run     # Build and start the server
```

Open <https://localhost:8443/> in your browser. `make run` enables the embedded
Dex OIDC provider (`--enable-insecure-dex`) for local development and tests.
Embedded Dex is unsupported in production; production deployments must
configure an external OIDC provider.
